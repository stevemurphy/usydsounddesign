Note:
Brief intro to AFTRS
Brief intro to ASSG


Those are my two professional identities - educator, film sound worker

But, what do I do? What, especially, does a sound designer do?

Some explanation of title, roles

Three points:
Sound Design/Sound Designers - who/overview
Workflow - what we do in detail
Theory - the why/functions of sound



Use skillshare video to go through workflow (edit, put clips on dropbox for linking slideshow)

Highlight some of the problems, e.g. when does sound design begin?
quote Randy Thom

Go through functions of sound
support story world
narrative
create realism/hyper-realism
genre
aesthetics
immersion/engagement

Reference theory of sound:

perceptual realism - audio and image appear in a way that causes the mind to connect them, and for unreal sounds/images to appear as real
(Langkjaer)

representation vs reproduction 
temporal synchronicity creates coherance suggesting perceptual naturalness - appears likely, even if not.
(Langkjaer)

added value (Chion Audio-Vision)
Sounds shows us the image differently than what the image shows alone (e.g. sounds off screen). The image likewise makes us hear sound differently than if no vision is present.

http://filmsound.org/chion/Added.htm

"The expressive and/or informative value with which a sound enriches a given image, so as to create the definite impression (either immediate or remembered) that this meaning emanates 'naturally' from the image itself."

Emotion (Thom)

Clarity & Density (Murch)
 a line between encoded messages (linguistics) to embodied (music)
