## Sound Design

### Stephen Murphy

- Head of Sound, AFTRS
- President, ASSG |

Note:
Brief intro to AFTRS
Brief intro to ASSG


Those are my two professional identities - educator, film sound worker

But, what do I do? What, especially, does a sound designer do?

Some explanation of title, roles

Three points:
Sound Design/Sound Designers - who/overview
Workflow - what we do in detail
Theory - the why/functions of sound



Use skillshare video to go through workflow (edit, put clips on dropbox for linking slideshow)

Highlight some of the problems, e.g. when does sound design begin?
quote Randy Thom

Go through functions of sound
support story world
narrative
create realism/hyper-realism
genre
aesthetics
immersion/engagement

Reference theory of sound, e.g. acousmatics
