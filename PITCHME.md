## Sound Design

Note:
Brief intro to AFTRS
Brief intro to ASSG


Those are my two professional identities - educator, film sound worker

But, what do I do? What, especially, does a sound designer do?

Some explanation of title, roles

Three points:
Sound Design/Sound Designers - who/overview
Workflow - what we do in detail
Theory - the why/functions of sound



Use skillshare video to go through workflow (edit, put clips on dropbox for linking slideshow)

Highlight some of the problems, e.g. when does sound design begin?
quote Randy Thom

Go through functions of sound
support story world
narrative
create realism/hyper-realism
genre
aesthetics
immersion/engagement

Reference theory of sound:

perceptual realism - audio and image appear in a way that causes the mind to connect them, and for unreal sounds/images to appear as real
(Langkjaer)

representation vs reproduction 
temporal synchronicity creates coherance suggesting perceptual naturalness - appears likely, even if not.
(Langkjaer)

added value (Chion Audio-Vision)
Sounds shows us the image differently than what the image shows alone (e.g. sounds off screen). The image likewise makes us hear sound differently than if no vision is present.

http://filmsound.org/chion/Added.htm

"The expressive and/or informative value with which a sound enriches a given image, so as to create the definite impression (either immediate or remembered) that this meaning emanates 'naturally' from the image itself."

Emotion (Thom)

Clarity & Density (Murch)
 a line between encoded messages (linguistics) to embodied (music)

## Sound Design

- Sound modifies visual perception, and vice versa |
- Cinema is not a visual medium, but multimodal    |
- Cinema is not primarily narrative, but affective |

## Sound Design

“Sound design ... is considered to be a process by which many sound fragments are created, selected, organised, and blended into a unified, coherent and immersive auditory image. Distinctive features of contemporary cinematic sound are a playful recombination of auditory and visual fragments, and a heightened manipulation of auditory spatialisation, temporal resolution, and timbre.”

(Ward 2015)

## Clarity and Density

“what began to interest me from a creative point of view was the point where I could see the forest and the trees – where there was simultaneously Clarity, which comes through a feeling for the individual elements (the notes), and Density, which comes through a feeling for the whole (the chord). And I found this balance point to occur most often when there were not quite three layers of something. I came to nickname this my _Law of Two-and-a-half_.”

## Clarity and Density

“my hope was the lasting impression of everything happening at once – Density – yet everything heard distinctly – Clarity. In fact...simultaneous Density and Clarity can only be achieved by a kind of subterfuge.”

(Murch 2005)

For this, really recommend listening to the video later, probably on headphones, so you can hear the holes and how the fill works.

Note:
"non-diagetic" - spelt wrong, and wrongly applied. This sound still comes from the story space. In this case, it is off-screen, and not sync/production, but those are not the same thing
