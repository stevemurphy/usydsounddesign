Those are my two professional identities - educator, film sound worker

*Overall*
Three points:
Sound Design/Sound Designers - who/overview
Workflow - what we do in detail
Theory - the why/functions of sound

### But

What do I really do?

Note:

But, what do I do? What, especially, does a sound designer do?

Sound design is many things:
- Industrial (roles, titles etc)
- Work (workflow, practice)
- Functional (functions and theory of sound/design)

Some explanation of title (history), roles, industrial models etc.

Next - let's look at the basic work and workflow

Note:
Use Skillshare video to go through workflow (using edited clip excerpts)

### Starting the Edit

### Spotting Session

Note:
Highlight some of the problems with this video/approach, e.g. when does sound design begin?

### The Dialogue Edit

Note:
For this, really recommend listening to the video later, probably on headphones, so you can hear the holes and how the fill works.

Note:
Reference Thom - it's when everything part of filmmaking comes together. And it should not just be adding something after the picture edit.

## The Function of Sound

What does sound really do?

Note:
Go through functions of sound
- support story world
- narrative
- create realism/hyper-realism
- genre
- aesthetics
- immersion/engagement

+++

## Sound Design

- Sound modifies visual perception, and vice versa |
- Cinema is not a visual medium, but multimodal    |
- Cinema is not primarily narrative, but affective |

(Ward 2015)

## Sound Design

“Sound design ... is considered to be a process by which many sound fragments are created, selected, organised, and blended into a unified, coherent and immersive auditory image. Distinctive features of contemporary cinematic sound are a playful recombination of auditory and visual fragments, and a heightened manipulation of auditory spatialisation, temporal resolution, and timbre.”

(Ward 2015)

Note:
Reference other theories of sound:

perceptual realism - audio and image appear in a way that causes the mind to connect them, and for unreal sounds/images to appear as real
(Langkjaer)

representation vs reproduction 
temporal synchronicity creates coherance suggesting perceptual naturalness - appears likely, even if not.
(Langkjaer)

## DENSE CLARITY
## CLEAR DENSITY

Note:
Clarity & Density (Murch)  
a continuum between encoded messages (linguistics) to embodied (music)

+++

## Clarity and Density

“what began to interest me from a creative point of view was the point where I could see the forest and the trees – where there was simultaneously Clarity, which comes through a feeling for the individual elements (the notes), and Density, which comes through a feeling for the whole (the chord). And I found this balance point to occur most often when there were not quite three layers of something. I came to nickname this my _Law of Two-and-a-half_.”

(Murch 2005)

## Clarity and Density

“my hope was the lasting impression of everything happening at once – Density – yet everything heard distinctly – Clarity. In fact...simultaneous Density and Clarity can only be achieved by a kind of subterfuge.”

(Murch 2005)

## Added Value

"The expressive and/or informative value with which a sound enriches a given image, so as to create the definite impression (either immediate or remembered) that this meaning emanates 'naturally' from the image itself."

http://filmsound.org/chion/Added.htm

Note:
Added value (Chion, Audio-Vision)

Sounds cause us to see the image differently compared to what it shows on its own. For example, sounds off screen change our sense of space and the world, expanding the image). The image likewise makes us hear sound differently than if there was image at all, only the sound.

### Diegetic sound

---?video=https://d.pr/6fYWI+

Note:
"non-diagetic" - spelt wrong, and wrongly applied. This sound still comes from the story space. In this case, it is off-screen, and not sync/production, but those are not the same thing.

But really, this is an example of added value.
